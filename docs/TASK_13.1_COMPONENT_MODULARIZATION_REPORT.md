## Bug Discovery & Resolution

### Critical Issue: Recursive Template Includes

**Problem:**
During initial test execution, all 11 tests failed with `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` in Django's template context management.

**Root Cause:**
Template files contained `{% include %}` tags in their documentation comments:
```django
{#
Grid Container Component
Usage:
  {% include 'components/portfolio/grid_container.html' ... %}
#}
```

Django's template loader was interpreting these as actual include directives during render, creating an infinite recursion loop when the template tried to include itself.

**Solution:**
Removed `{% %}` template tags from all usage documentation comments, converting them to plain text:
```django
{#
Grid Container Component
Usage:
  include 'components/portfolio/grid_container.html' ...  (no tags)
#}
```

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ project_card.html
- ✅ section_header.html
- ✅ stat_card.html
- ✅ empty_state.html
- ✅ grid_container.html

## Design System Integration

### Responsive Breakpoints Used
- `md:` - Medium breakpoint (768px+)
- `lg:` - Large breakpoint (1024px+)
- Default mobile-first responsive design

### Tailwind Utilities
- Grid system: `grid-cols-1`, `md:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-3`, `lg:grid-cols-4`
- Spacing: `mb-16`, `mb-8`, `gap-4`, `gap-6`, `gap-8`
- Typography: `text-2xl`, `font-bold`, `text-white`, `text-gray-400`
- Colors: `text-primary-400`, `text-white`, `text-gray-500`

### CSS Grid Implementation
- Flexible column layouts (1-4 columns)
- Responsive gap sizing (4px-8px)
- Mobile-first approach
