# UI/UX Code Review Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures consistent, high-quality UI/UX code changes across the Django portfolio project. Use this for reviewing all UI/UX related pull requests and changes.

## Pre-Review Setup

- [ ] Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Ensure tests pass (`pytest -m "ui or visual or theme or animation"`)

### Motion & Animation
- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- [ ] Provides static alternatives for complex animations
- [ ] No content relies solely on motion to convey information
- [ ] Animation duration and easing are reasonable

---

## üåê Browser Compatibility

## üìû Escalation

If any of these checklist items cannot be completed or present significant concerns:

1. Tag the UI/UX lead for guidance
2. Document the concern in the PR comments
3. Consider breaking large changes into smaller, reviewable chunks
4. Ensure proper testing is in place before proceeding

*This checklist is based on the Phase 7 UI/UX implementation and should be updated as the design system evolves.*
