---

## Task 15.1: CI Pipeline Optimization ✅

### Overview
Implemented intelligent CI/CD pipeline with conditional test execution based on file changes, comprehensive artifact generation, HTML reporting with notifications, and pipeline metrics collection.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Conditional Test Scenarios (Based on Changed Files)

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml`

**Features Implemented:**
- **Path Filter Integration:** Using `dorny/paths-filter@v3` action
- **File Type Detection:**
  - Python files (`.py`, `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript files (`static/js/**`, `frontend/**/*.js`, `package.json`)
  - CSS files (`static/css/**`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`)
  - Templates (`templates/**/*.html`)
  - Tests (`tests/**`)
  - Configuration files (`.github/**`, Docker files)
  - Documentation (`docs/**`, `*.md`)

**Conditional Job Execution:**
```yaml
python-tests:
  needs: detect-changes
  if: needs.detect-changes.outputs.python == 'true' || needs.detect-changes.outputs.tests == 'true'

javascript-tests:
  needs: detect-changes
  if: needs.detect-changes.outputs.javascript == 'true' || needs.detect-changes.outputs.tests == 'true'

e2e-tests:
  if: |
    needs.detect-changes.outputs.python == 'true' ||
    needs.detect-changes.outputs.javascript == 'true' ||
    needs.detect-changes.outputs.templates == 'true' ||
    needs.detect-changes.outputs.tests == 'true'
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Reduced CI execution time (skip unnecessary tests)
- 💰 Lower CI/CD costs (fewer compute minutes)
- 🎯 Focused testing (only test what changed)
- ⏱️ Faster feedback loops for developers

  ```yaml
  - name: Upload Playwright report
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: playwright-report-${{ matrix.browser }}
      path: |
        playwright-report/
        test-results/
      retention-days: 30
  ```

**Lighthouse Integration:**
- **Automated Performance Audits:** Run on relevant file changes
- **Multiple URL Testing:** Homepage, Blog, Portfolio, Contact, Tools
