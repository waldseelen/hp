## üìù Code Review Comments Template

### For Reviewers
Use these templates when leaving review comments:

**Style Issue:**
```
Consider using semantic CSS variables instead of hard-coded colors.
Example: `bg-background-primary` instead of `bg-gray-900`
```

**Performance Concern:**
```
This query might cause N+1 problem. Consider using `select_related()`.
```

**Accessibility Issue:**
```
Missing ARIA label for this interactive element. Screen readers need context.
```

**Testing Request:**
```
Please add unit tests for this component logic, especially the error handling.
```

### Response Templates
**Acknowledged:**
```
‚úÖ Good catch! Fixed in [commit hash]
```

**Discussion Needed:**
```
ü§î Interesting point. Let's discuss the trade-offs between X and Y approaches.
```

**Will Address Later:**
```
üìù Created issue #123 to address this in a follow-up PR.
