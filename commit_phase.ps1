## PHASE 3: SECURITY & ERROR HANDLING (Priority: MEDIUM - 2-3 Days)

### Task 3.1: Comprehensive Error Handling - COMPLETED
**Action:**
- [x] Implement consistent error handling across all views (error_handlers.py active, URL handlers configured)
- [x] Add proper logging with structured format (StructuredLogger with JSON format implemented)
- [x] Create custom error pages (404, 500, 403, 400) (templates/errors/ directory with styled templates)
- [x] Set up error monitoring and alerting (ErrorMonitor class with email alerts, ADMINS configured)
**Verification:**
- [x] All exceptions properly logged with structured format (StructuredLogger.log_error method)
- [x] User-friendly error messages with custom templates (safe_render function with fallbacks)
- [x] No stack traces exposed to users (Custom error handlers return safe responses)
- [x] Error rates tracked and monitored (ErrorMonitor class with thresholds and alerting)
**Outcome:**
- [x] Complete error handling system: structured logging, custom error pages, monitoring, and user-friendly messages

### Task 3.2: Security Hardening - COMPLETED
**Action:**
- [x] Review and update CSP headers (Stricter CSP with nonce, NEL reporting, Permissions-Policy implemented)
- [x] Implement rate limiting on all endpoints (Global + API-specific middleware active with patterns)
- [x] Add CSRF protection to all forms (Contact form has CSRF, meta tag in base template)
- [x] Security audit of all user inputs (API validation strengthened, input sanitization implemented)
**Verification:**
- [x] CSP headers updated with stricter policies (Nonce-based CSP with reporting endpoints)
- [x] Rate limiting prevents abuse (RateLimitMiddleware + APIRateLimitMiddleware active)
- [x] All forms CSRF protected (CSRF middleware active, tokens implemented)
- [x] Production security settings configured (HSTS, secure cookies, SSL redirect)
**Outcome:**
- [x] Production-ready security posture with comprehensive protection

### Task 3.3: Input Validation & Sanitization - COMPLETED
**Action:**
- [x] Add proper validation to all forms (ContactForm with comprehensive validation, honeypot protection)
- [x] Implement input sanitization for user content (InputSanitizer class with HTML stripping, pattern validation)
- [x] Add file upload security checks (FileTypeValidator, SecureFileValidator classes with MIME validation)
- [x] Validate all API inputs (Enhanced with validate_json_input function and API_SCHEMAS)
**Verification:**
- [x] All inputs validated server-side (Django forms, API validation functions, comprehensive validators)
- [x] No XSS vulnerabilities (strip_tags, input sanitization, CSRF protection, dangerous content detection)
- [x] File uploads secure (MIME type validation, size limits, malicious file detection, extension checks)
**Outcome:**
- [x] Complete secure user input handling with comprehensive validation and sanitization

### Task 3.4: Advanced Authentication Security - COMPLETED
**Action:**
- [x] Implement Two-Factor Authentication with TOTP (Admin model with TOTP methods, QR code generation)
- [x] Add login attempt rate limiting (Account locking after 5 failed attempts, time-based restrictions)
- [x] Create session management dashboard (UserSession model, session tracking, termination capabilities)
- [x] Set up password strength requirements (Password validation with complexity rules)
**Verification:**
- [x] 2FA setup and login flow works (TOTP verification, backup codes, SecureAuthBackend)
- [x] Brute force attacks prevented (Failed login tracking, account locking mechanism)
- [x] Users can manage active sessions (Session dashboard, terminate individual/all sessions)
**Outcome:**
- [x] Enterprise-grade authentication security

### Task 3.5: GDPR & Privacy Compliance - COMPLETED
**Action:**
- [x] Create cookie consent banner with preferences
- [x] Implement data export functionality
- [x] Add account deletion with data purge
- [x] Create privacy policy page
**Verification:**
- [x] Cookie consent properly manages tracking (Comprehensive consent system with 5 categories, preferences modal, CSRF protection)
- [x] User data export includes all personal data (JSON/CSV/ZIP formats, comprehensive data collection from all models)
- [x] Account deletion removes all user traces (Soft/Hard deletion options, data anonymization, complete purge capability)
- [x] Privacy policy page created (KVKK/GDPR compliant, user rights explained, legal information included)
**Outcome:**
- [x] Full GDPR/KVKK compliance (Cookie consent system, data export, account deletion, privacy dashboard, URL structure)

**Phase Outcome:**
- [x] The project is protected against external threats with comprehensive error management, security hardening, input validation mechanisms, enterprise-grade authentication, and full privacy compliance.
