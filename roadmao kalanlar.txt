## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Free/Low-Cost Alternatives
| Need | Free Option | Paid Alternative | When to Switch |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Database | Neon.tech (free tier) | Railway ($10) | >1GB data |
| Redis | Redis Labs (30MB free) | Railway ($5) | >30MB cache |
| CDN | Cloudflare (unlimited) | AWS CloudFront | >10TB/month |
| Monitoring | Sentry (5k events) | Sentry Team ($26) | >5k errors/month |
| Email | SendGrid (100/day) | SendGrid Essentials ($15) | >100/day |
| Domain | Namecheap ($1/month) | N/A | - |

### Money-Saving Tips
1. **Start with Tier 1** ($6/month) - Sufficient for MVP
2. **Use free tiers** - Cloudflare, Sentry, SendGrid basics are free
3. **Monitor usage** - Set up billing alerts to avoid surprises
4. **Optimize queries** - Slow queries cost money (compute time)
5. **Cache aggressively** - Reduce database load = lower costs
6. **Compress assets** - Lower bandwidth = lower costs
7. **Use spot/preemptible instances** - 60-80% cheaper for non-critical workloads

### Cost vs. User Growth
```
Users/Month     Monthly Cost    Cost per User
0-1k            $6              $0.006
1k-10k          $111            $0.011-$0.111
10k-100k        $755            $0.008-$0.076
100k+           $1500+          $0.015+
```

**Key Insight:** Cost per user *decreases* as you scale efficiently.

### 2. Monitoring & Alerting (Phase 21 Reference)
**Monitoring Setup:**
- `docs/operations/monitoring-guide.md` - Complete setup guide
- `docs/operations/incident-response.md` - How to respond to alerts

**Alert Severity Levels:**
- **P0 Critical**: Page on-call immediately (5-min response)
  - Site down, database offline, >1% error rate
- **P1 Warning**: Notify team next day (24-hour response)
  - Slow response times, high memory usage
- **P2 Info**: Review in weekly meeting
  - Cache hit rate low, disk space warnings

**Monitoring Dashboards:**
1. **Sentry**: Error tracking (`sentry.io/dashboard`)
2. **Railway**: Infrastructure metrics (`railway.app/metrics`)
3. **Google Analytics**: User metrics
4. **Uptime Robot**: Uptime monitoring (99.9% target)

---

### 3. Incident Response (Emergency Procedures)
**When production is down:**
1. **Acknowledge** (1 min): Post in #incidents channel
2. **Assess** (2 min): Check Sentry, logs, monitoring dashboards
3. **Rollback** (5 min): Follow rollback procedure if needed
4. **Fix** (30 min): Apply hotfix if rollback not needed
5. **Verify** (10 min): Run smoke tests, check monitoring
6. **Post-mortem** (24 hours): Document what happened and how to prevent

**Rollback Procedure (5 minutes):**
```bash
# 1. Find last known good version
git log --oneline | head -10

# 2. Rollback to previous version
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push production main

# 3. Verify
curl https://yourdomain.com/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# 4. Monitor for 10 minutes
# Watch Sentry, response times, error rates
```

---

### 4. Backup & Recovery (Phase 20 Reference)
**Backup Strategy:**
- **Database**: Daily automated backups (Railway/AWS RDS)
- **Media files**: Daily sync to S3/GCS
- **Code**: Git (always backed up)
- **Configuration**: Store in version control

**Recovery Procedures:**
```bash
# Restore database from backup
railway db:restore <backup-id>

# Restore media files
aws s3 sync s3://backup-bucket/media/ media/

# Verify
python manage.py check
python manage.py migrate --check
```

**Test restores quarterly** to ensure backups work.
