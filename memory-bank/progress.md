# Progress

Current Status
- Memory Bank initialized and linked in `AGENTS.md`.
- Core files created with repo-aware placeholders.
- Navigation container tokens introduced; About page layout refactored for readability.
- Home page sections centred with new animations and responsive styling.

What Works
- Repository structure validated: Django apps and frontend tooling present.
- Makefile, tests, and lint configurations detected.

What’s Left
- Confirm product goals and user journeys; complete `productContext.md`.
- Verify dev/test pipelines end-to-end locally.
- Document deployment process based on actual targets (e.g., Railway, Vercel, etc.).

Known Issues / Questions
- Need confirmation on Django ↔ Next.js integration strategy.
- Validate Celery usage and required infrastructure.

Next Checkpoint
